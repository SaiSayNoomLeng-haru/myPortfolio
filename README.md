### Bio
- Hello, my name is Sai Say Noom Leng. I'm a self-taught web developer currently learning and developing front-end. I'm an active student at Columbia College, Missouri majoring in Computer Science. I started off my software engineering journey with web programming. I love web technologies especially JavaScript and React and I'm confident enough to start off my web programming career with front-end development. I've been self-studying from Coursera and I've already got several certifcates from it.
